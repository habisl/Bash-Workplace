Here Document

A here document is used to redirect input into an interactive shell script or program.

We can run an interactive program within a shell script without user action by supplying the required input for the interactive program, or interactive shell script.

The general form for a here document is −

command << delimiter document delimiter Here the shell interprets the << operator as an instruction to read input until it finds a line containing the specified delimiter. All the input lines up to the line containing the delimiter are then fed into the standard input of the command.

The delimiter tells the shell that the here document has completed. Without it, the shell continues to read input forever. The delimiter must be a single word that does not contain spaces or tabs.

Following is the input to the command wc -l to count total number of line −

$wc -l << EOF

    in Cape Town.
EOF

$
You can use here document to print multiple lines using your script as follows −

#!/bin/sh

cat << EOF
This is a simple lookup program 
for good (and bad) restaurants
in Cape Town.
EOF 
This would produce following result −

This is a simple lookup program for good (and bad) restaurants in Cape Town. The following script runs a session with the vi text editor and save the input in the file test.txt.

#!/bin/sh

filename=test.txt
vi $filename <<EndOfCommands

If you run this script with vim acting as vi, then you will likely see output like the following −

$ sh test.sh
Vim: Warning: Input is not from a terminal
$
After running the script, you should see the following added to the file test.txt −

$ cat test.txt
